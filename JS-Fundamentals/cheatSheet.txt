the splice() method in array means to cut off some part of an array accept at-least 2 argument
Argument includes  
(start, end, (replace value optional))
for example: you can remove this 
const num = [5, 6, 8, 7, 12];
num.splice(1,3) // start at index 1 and ends at index 3 that's 
from (6,8,7) will be remove giving us back: [5,12]
you can replace a value you remove by adding extra number next to it like this num.splice(1,3,13) remove 
and replace that place with 13 and it will return [5,13,12]

Okay, here's a cheat sheet summarizing our discussion on JavaScript array methods forEach, slice, and splice:

JavaScript Array Method Cheat Sheet

1. forEach(callback)

Purpose: Executes a function callback for each element in an array.

Return Value: undefined (does not return a new array).

Modifies Original Array? No.

return Keyword: return inside the callback only skips the current iteration; it doesn't stop the loop.

Example:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num * 2)); // Output: 2, 4, 6


2. slice(startIndex, endIndex)

Purpose: Creates a new array containing a portion of the original array.

startIndex: The index to start the slice (inclusive).

endIndex: The index to end the slice (exclusive - the element at this index is not included). If omitted, slices to the end.

Return Value: A new array.

Modifies Original Array? No.

Example:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const slicedArray = numbers.slice(1, 4); // slicedArray: [2, 3, 4]

3. splice(startIndex, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)

Purpose: Modifies the original array by removing, replacing, or adding elements in place.

startIndex: The index to start modifying.

deleteCount: The number of elements to remove. If 0, no elements are removed. If omitted, all elements from startIndex to the end are removed.

item1, item2, ...: Optional. The elements to add to the array.

Return Value: An array containing the removed elements (empty array [] if no elements were removed).

Modifies Original Array? Yes.

Example:

const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
const removed = fruits.splice(1, 1, "kiwi"); // removed: ["banana"], fruits: ["apple", "kiwi", "orange"]

Key Reminders:

slice() is non-mutating (creates a new array).

splice() is mutating (modifies the original array).

endIndex in slice() is exclusive.

The return keyword behaves differently inside forEach than in map or filter.
This cheat sheet should provide a quick reference for these common array methods. Remember to practice using them to solidify your understanding.
