the splice() method in array means to cut off some part of an array accept at-least 2 argument
Argument includes  
(start, end, (replace value optional))
for example: you can remove this 
const num = [5, 6, 8, 7, 12];
num.splice(1,3) // start at index 1 and ends at index 3 that's 
from (6,8,7) will be remove giving us back: [5,12]
you can replace a value you remove by adding extra number next to it like this num.splice(1,3,13) remove 
and replace that place with 13 and it will return [5,13,12]
